        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Al-Quds (Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם Yerushalayim) is the largest city in occupied historical Palestine in terms ,<br>
            of area and population, and the most important religiously and economically. It is known by other names <br>
            in the Arabic language, such as: Bait Al-Maqdis, Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the first of the two Qiblas, and in <br>
            the Bible as Jerusalem, and Israel officially calls it: Jerusalem Al-Quds. <br><br><br>

            Arabs, Palestinians, and a wide range of supporters of the Palestinian cause consider it the capital of <br>
            the future state of Palestine after liberation, as stated in the document of the Palestinian Declaration <br>
            of Independence that took place in Algeria on November 15, 1988 AD, (As for historically, their Jebusite <br>
            ancestors were the first to build and inhabit the city in the fifth millennium BC). While Israel considers<br>
            it its unified capital, after annexing the eastern part of the city in 1980 AD, which it occupied after <br>
            the 1967 war (the Jews consider it their religious and national capital for more than 3000 years). As for <br>
            the United Nations and the international community, it does not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,<br>
            considers East Jerusalem part of the Palestinian territories, and does not recognize its annexation to the Hebrew <br>
            state, with some exceptions. Jerusalem is located within the Hebron mountain range and mediates the area between<br> 
            the Mediterranean Sea and the northern end of the Dead Sea. This city has grown and expanded its borders much more<br> 
            than it was in previous eras.<br>
